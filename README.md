```

Frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Testing

Our application includes extensive testing to ensure functionality and reliability:

- **Backend Testing:** Utilizes JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration tests.
- **Frontend Testing:** Employs React Testing Library to simulate user interaction.
- **Security Testing:** Conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## DevOps
### Docker and Kubernetes Integration

In this DevOps section, we automate development, deployment, and management for fast and reliable delivery of functionality to end users in the INE-Learning platform.

- **Docker for Development and Deployment:** We use Docker to containerize our backend and frontend, ensuring a consistent development environment, simplified dependency management, and seamless scaling.
- **Kubernetes for Orchestration**: We use Kubernetes to automate deployment, scaling, and operations for high availability and reliability of our Docker containers.

Together, Docker and Kubernetes form a powerful combination that empowers us to deliver a stable and scalable E-Learning platform, meeting the needs of our users effectively.
